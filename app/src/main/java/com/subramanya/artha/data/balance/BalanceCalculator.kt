/**
 * Pure-Kotlin balance derivation. Account balances and credit-card outstandings are
 * NEVER stored — they are recomputed from the transaction log whenever the inputs change.
 *
 * Direction rules (mirror the source/destination convention documented on
 * TransactionEntity):
 *   - source = the affected account/card on the user's side.
 *   - destination = second affected side, only used for TRANSFER and CARD_PAYMENT in Phase 1.
 *   - The TransactionType decides whether money flows in or out of source/destination.
 *
 * For accounts:
 *   - EXPENSE, LOAN_GIVEN, GIFT_SENT, INVESTMENT_BUY        → source loses money
 *   - TRANSFER, CARD_PAYMENT                                 → source loses, destination gains
 *   - INCOME, REFUND, CASHBACK, INTEREST,
 *     LOAN_RECEIVED, GIFT_RECEIVED, INVESTMENT_SELL          → source gains money
 *   - ADJUSTMENT                                             → signed by amount (negative allowed)
 *
 * For credit cards (outstanding = how much the user owes):
 *   - EXPENSE, LOAN_GIVEN, GIFT_SENT charged TO the card    → outstanding increases
 *   - any "money in" type ON the card (INCOME, REFUND,
 *     CASHBACK, INTEREST, LOAN_RECEIVED, GIFT_RECEIVED,
 *     INVESTMENT_SELL)                                       → outstanding decreases
 *   - CARD_PAYMENT where destination = card                 → outstanding decreases (bill paid)
 *   - ADJUSTMENT                                             → signed by amount
 *
 * The credit set is the same MONEY_INTO_SOURCE used for accounts, so e.g. a refund posted
 * as a plain INCOME directly onto the card still pays it down (symmetric with accounts).
